TripleRush: A Distributed In-Memory Graph Store
===============================================

The rocky experiment attempts to take advantage of MapDB and Akka clustering features to simplify the TripleRush implementation.

How to develop in Eclipse
-------------------------
Install the [Typesafe IDE for Scala 2.11](http://scala-ide.org/download/sdk.html).

Ensure that Eclipse uses a Java 8 library and JVM: Preferences → Java → Installed JREs → JRE/JDK 8 should be installed and selected.

Import the project into Eclipse: File → Import... → Maven → Existing Maven Projects → select "triplerush" folder

Thanks a lot to
